    _ VIRGIL.From the indifferent success which has attended the several attempts to translate Virgil into our language, one would be at first led to imagine that it is next to impossible to transfuse the spirit of Roman poetry into Engliſh, and to cast the blame on our tongue, not on our translators; did not Rowe's admirable version of Lucan refute such an opinion. Whatever may be the reason, no great ancient poet is less indebted to translators than Virgil; nor without acquaintance with him in his native language can any adequate idea be formed of his peculiar genius and excellence.Dryden, himself a great poet, is often unfaithful, diffuse, licentious, or negligent. I have never met with any person who recollected twenty lines together of his translation, while hundreds not only remember, but cannot forget, almost whole books of the original. The version of Pitt is less licentious, in particular passages more brilliant, but upon the whole languid: while Trap, as Doctor Johnson observes, is now only a clandestine refuge for the laziness of school-boys. A translation of Ariosto is extant, which like Trap's of Virgil, retains every word of the meaning without one spark of the spirit of the author: these versions may remind us of an experiment which has been attempted, of turning brandy into water. Such is the common inferiority of translation.With respect to Virgil, the difficulty consists perhaps in this. One of the principal charms of his poetry lies in the admirable choice of his terms, the most significant and sonorous in which his images can be expressed; another, in the harmonious dignity and majeſtick stream of his numbers. Like his own Clitumnus, the course is smooth, but the picture is diversified with enlivening and splendid objects. He has, however, a style and composition peculiar to himself. An imitator may have many beauties, without having the beauties of Virgil. Let the English poet, for a poet he should be who attempts to resemble him, first form to himself a style, choice, rich, and glowing as his language can furnish; and giving this all the variety of modulation of which it is capable, adhere to it from the beginning, for Virgil is never unequal; and after he has completed an excellent poem, which can stand by itself with all the air of an original, he may then assure himself that he has done some justice to Maro. Pope has effected this with the Iliad. If it is not like Homer, as some are pleased to affirm, it must at least be allowed to stand alone unimitated and inimitable.Rowe, in my opinion, would have translated Virgil better than Dryden; for though he had not equal scope and fire of genius, his taste was more correct, he was less careless, and more pathetick; and I imagine, had more literature, or had better improved the care employed in his education. It may be doubted whether a very good taste be not more requisite to make a good translator, than great genius. I do not however mean to insinuate that Pope did not possess both most eminently; though I have lived to hear (heu nefas!) the coarse couplets of the occasional Churchill preferred to his immortal labours.Happening lately to cast my eye over a page or two of Dryden's version of the Georgicks, it really appeared to me like burlesque; more contemptibly ludicrous than the avowed travesty of Cotton; with no more resemblance to the beautiful original, than subsists beween the mask of an ape and the countenance of Antinous.—Let the reader who has curiosity, and a little time to mispend, turn to the technical storm in the first Aeneid, full of the language of the dock-yard, and to other disfigured passages; he will not hesitate to pronounce this great poet convicted either of most vicious taste, or of elaborate affectation. When I reflect, in particular, how he has contrived to degrade that eminently beautiful passage just mentioned, I can hardly forbear crying out with Angelo, —Having waste ground enough,Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!The inequalities of Shakspeare are not more frequent, or so unaccountable, as those of the literate John Dryden. There is indeed as much difference between Virgil in his Roman toga, and his Engliſh doublet, as between a forest tree in June and January, or as between the right and the wrong side of Gobelin tapestry.Who that has read the late Mr. Mickle's version of the Lusiad, but must wish he had turned his thoughts to the Aeneid? He would probably have had the same success with Virgil as with Camoens.—Cervantes in the sixth chapter of the first book of Don Quixote, speaking of poetical translations, determines against them thus: "—y lo mesmo haràn todos aquellos que los libros de verso quisieren volver en otra lengua; que, por mucho cuydado que pongan, y habilidad que muestren, jamas llegeràn al punto que ellos tienen en su primer nacimiento." The Lusiad of Mickle is a shining exception.Would the painter of the BOTANICK GARDEN condescend to become a translator of Virgil, we should see the English Georgicks illuminated with the brightest radiance of poetical genius, and, like the clouds round a fulgent setting sun in autumn, glowing with all the richness of gold and purple. His profusion of fancy and luxuriance of diction would not suffer much injury from the little restraint of conformity to a model so excellent. A. U. C. 684—735.

    _ TIBULLUS.The tender suavity of Tibullus, and his plaintive simplicity, cannot be too much admired; yet it has been said that his pattern was Parthenius, upon the authority, I think, of Macrobius. Of the writings of Parthenius little has been preserved. Too much indulgence has been given to the humour of preferring works which are lost to those which remain; and of regretting the want of those originals, upon which we are to suppose the excellent, though inferior, poems which we have in our hands, were formed. In this manner we must conceive Lucillius to have been superior to Horace, Varus to Virgil, and Parthenius to Tibullus. No better consequence can result from this fruitless repining after unknown and perished perfection, than to diminish the satisfaction of our actual enjoyment, by the mixture of another sentiment not so pleasing. But in our own experience we may find the true consolation. There is little doubt, that had we now only a few lucky fragments of Chaucer and Donne, some of our criticks would prefer them to Dryden and Pope; for Dryden himself in order to recommend his beautiful tale of Palamon and Arcite, modernized from Chaucer, and infinitely improved, spends several pages of the preface to his Fables, to raise the rugged old English bard to a competition with Ovid; nay, in his dedicatory verses to the Duchess of Ormond, he boldly sets him above Homer and Virgil: He match'd their beauties, where they most excell,Of love sung better, and of arms as well. So sings Dryden; but poetry without harmony is to my sense no better than a violin without strings, or a cracked trumpet.The only ancient prodigy of England is Shakspeare. His numbers are often not less sweet, than his conceptions are sublime and original. Had only a few of his best scenes and dramas descended to us, well might the modern exclaim that the loss of the rest was irreparable. Yet even in this mighty genius something is to be forgiven, and something to be rejected. Where he possesses his true inspiration, he never was, nor ever will be, equalled. "Nature (as Pope says) speaks through him."Neither are the praises lavished by contemporary writers on each other a sure standard at all times to ascertain their real value. Horace, the most discerning of criticks, though superior to envy, now and then pays a courtly compliment to the productions of a Roman pen, when in the hand of a great statesman or magistrate, which their intrinsick merit probably would not have extorted from him. Lord Halifax, the Bufo of Great-Britain, has left his verses behind him to give the lie to his flatterers; to reach us to appreciate for ourselves, and not to depend upon the panegyrick even of an Addison, when the scribbler and the minister happen to be united in the same person.In Tibullus the charms of elegy may be found in genuine perfection. He has been well imitated, and better translated, by the English Hammond. Lord Chesterfield in a short preface to the Love Elegies, seems aware that his friend may be considered only in the character of a translator; and says artfully enough, that "he chose Tibullus rather than Ovid as his model." It is somewhat extraordinary that Dr. Johnson in his account of this English poet, when he very justly condemns him for introducing Roman imagery and heathen mythology into verses supposed to be the effusions of amorous passion, does not seem to recollect that in all these passages and many more, Hammond is only the literal translator of Tibullus. Had this circumstance been fairly acknowledged by himself or his noble editor, he would have escaped the severity of Johnson's censure. To the best of my recollection there are scarcely one hundred original lines in Hammond's Love Elegies.Since the foregoing remark was written, it has been suggested to me by a friend, that the same observation was made soon after the appearance of the biographical work above referred to: "Dr. Johnson, in his late admirable LIVES OF THE ENGLISH POETS, speaking of Mr. Hammond, observes, that 'his elegies have neither pathos, nature, or manners.' They certainly have neither of the latter; and whatever of the former they contain is the passion of a Roman, not of an Englishman. It is surprising that the cause of this defect escaped this most judicious critick. In short, these elegies are almost all, if not translations, very close imitations, of Tibullus. In the whole number there are but four original. Of this any one may be convinced, who will take the trouble to compare these poems with those of the Roman Knight. For the satisfaction of the classical reader, I will subjoin a list of those elegies which Hammond has copied:
HAMMOND.TIBULLUS.El. 1l. ii. el. iv. 1—38.2ii. el. vi.3ii. el. iv. 39—50.4iii. el. v.5i. el. ii.6ii. el. vii.7ii. el. iii.8iii. el. iii.9iii. el. ii.11i. el. xi.i. el. i. 45—52.12iii. el. vii.13i. el. i.i. el. v. 31—34.By the foregoing table the reader will observe, that of Hammond's elegies, the tenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth, alone appear to have been unborrowed. It is, however, but just to add, that this unfortunate and amiable poet, though he has no pretensions to the title of an original writer, must be acknowledged to have been a very harmonious and elegant versifier. Gentleman's Magazine, for 1781, Vol. 51. p. 369. A. U. C. 691—734.

    _ HORACE.The genius and writings of Horace will probably for ever supply abundant matter for criticism and panegyrick. He has a claim to the latter, for a species of excellence which perhaps has not been sufficiently noticed; the great variety of subjects to which he has tuned his lyre. To have produced above a hundred odes, with little resemblance between any two of them, all finished and beautiful, and some of them sublime, shews a very surprising playfulness and fertility of fancy. He calls them operosa carmina, but we see nothing but the felicity.Considering his admiration of Pindar, whom he praises chiefly for his sublimity, we might, I think, have expected more frequent emulation of the Theban's loftiness. His most distinguished performance in that style is the ode in the fourth book, beginning with "Qualem ministrum," yet surely this ought not to be preferred to Dryden's St. Cecilia, and is greatly surpassed by THE BARD of Gray. Dryden's ode is perfect, but the latin is disgraced by the following passage, if indeed it be genuine, flatly prosaick, and damping at once all the glowing ardour of the strain, by its unexpected chilness: ——quibusMos unde deductus per omneTempus Amazoniâ securiDextras obarmet, quaerere distuli;Nec scire fas est omnia.A slight compression of the same thought, with another cast of expression, would have made it unexceptionable. As it is, the Polyhymnia of Cibber might be ashamed of it. Very rarely indeed does Horace degrade a sentiment by cloathing it improperly.Mr. Mason's superiority as a Lyrick Poet seems in some degree to be overlooked in the admiration of his two dramas with which his odes are interwoven; yet what taste can be insensible to the charms of those beautiful compositions in Elfrida? That upon death in Caractacus breathes the genuine spirit of Homer's terrifick grandeur and sublimity.No species of poetical composition is so difficult as the grave Ode. It demands not only peculiar endowment from nature, but also talents exercised in the practice. An indifferent serious ode, though constructed with the most exact conformity to critical rules, was never read twice willingly by any person, except the author. Even the incomparable Pope, accustomed so much to couplets and heroick measure, fails in the attempt, almost shamefully. His St. Cecilia is the mere effort of labour, without inspiration; a sedulous endeavour at perfection, without attainment. I can conceive Dryden, when employed on this subject, looking up to the sky, while the spirit of the musical saint he celebrates was descending upon him; and Pope, in vain discomposing his velvet night-cap, biting his pen, dashing it on the table, and retiring to bed, tired, disturbed, and unsatisfied. Such is the difference between imitation and genius.When the subject of an ode is of an exalted nature, it requires all the united powers of conception, expression, and harmony, to prevent the mind from being vacant, instead of being roused and sustained by the poetry. Upon light, ludicrous, or satyrical topicks, many have been successful; no one perhaps more eminently so, than Sir Charles Hanbury Williams. A. U. C. 689—746.

    _ OVID.It is singular enough that Ovid should have collected such a number of fabulous transformations and impossibilities, and have given them to his countrymen with such an air of gravity and devotion, without having himself the least faith in any of them; for a man of sense who examined them so much as he must have done, was of all men the least likely to believe them. His Metamorphoses may be considered as the great magazine and repository of pagan fiction and mythology.He is supposed to have been greatly addicted to gallantry, and a very distinguished favourite among the Roman ladies, to whom he recommended himself more by his learning, talents, and poetry, than by the gracefulness of his figure, and his other personal accomplishments. He had besides reduced the mystery of female seduction to a system. There are few women of any natural delicacy of sentiment, however little they may happen to be indebted for the improvement of their minds to education, who can be insensible to the distinction which literature gives to the other sex. Nothing is less uncommon, than to find a woman's principles seduced by her understanding.The late Earl of Chesterfield's morality with respect to women, is rather more lax than Ovid's. In his Art of Love, the Roman says, Tuta frequensque via est, per amicum fallere nomen.Tuta frequensque licet sit via; crimen habet.The English Chiron, like the pirate who erased the eighth commandment from his decalogue. seems to have adopted the convenience of the couplet, leaving out the assertion contained in the final words. By what casuistry a man of unblemished reputation in his publick character, and of strict honour in private, as his lordship certainly was, could confound the same principles, by the mere distinction of sexes, I am unable to discover. It is surely to be lamented, that a few exceptionable passages in his system, which cannot be perused without severe reprehension, should have so tarnished the whole, that no publication extant has been treated with so little candour. It abounds however with good sense, and contains many excellent rules and maxims to form the manners and regulate the conduct of youth, conceived with great temper and judgment, and communicated with the utmost perspicuity, elegance, and purity of language. Though his letters are addressed to a young man of a particular character, and destined to a particular walk in life, they cannot fail of being generally instructive and useful. The characters by Lord Chesterfield, of a few of his contemporaries, are written in the spirit of Sallust, without his partialities; terse, comprehensive, and appropriate, and equal, if not superior, to any of those drawn by our best historians, from Lord Clarendon to this hour. A. U. C. 711—771.
